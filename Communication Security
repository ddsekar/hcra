The updated Section 6.3 below replaces only the two relevant subsections while keeping the rest of the document intact.

### 6.3 Communication Security

#### Control Plane to Zeebe

- **Protocol**: gRPC over TLS 1.3  
- **Authentication**: mTLS using client certificates issued by a trusted internal CA  
- **Scope**: ASTRADeploy and ControlCenter communicate with Zeebe gateway for deployments and workflow control  

#### Zeebe to ASTRAPlane (via AWS VPC Lattice)

- **Protocol**:  
  - Amazon VPC Lattice service network as the application-layer service mesh between the Zeebe VPC and tenant ASTRAPlane VPCs  
  - HTTP/HTTPS over TLS as the transport protocol exposed by VPC Lattice endpoints[1][2]

- **Authentication**:  
  - AWS SigV4 request signing using IAM roles associated with Zeebe worker pods or tasks (IRSA for EKS or task roles for ECS)[3][4]
  - Temporary credentials obtained via AWS STS; all calls to ASTRAPlane connector services are signed with SigV4 and include `Authorization`, `x-amz-date`, `x-amz-security-token`, and payload hash headers[4][3]

- **Authorization**:  
  - VPC Lattice **auth policies** on the service network and individual services define which IAM principals (Zeebe worker roles in the orchestrator account) can invoke ASTRAPlane services[5][6]
  - Resource-based policies on Lattice services restrict access by AWS account, organization ID, and optionally source VPC, ensuring tenant-scoped access only[6][7]

- **Network Isolation**:  
  - Zeebe and ASTRAPlane VPCs are associated to a shared VPC Lattice service network, without requiring VPC peering or Transit Gateway  
  - Security groups and Lattice-managed endpoints ensure only authorized Zeebe workers can reach ASTRAPlane connector services[8][9]

- **Encryption**:  
  - TLS termination handled by VPC Lattice with certificates from AWS Certificate Manager; optional HTTPS on the ASTRAPlane target to maintain end‑to‑end encryption[10][11]

#### Control Plane to ASTRAPlane (Observability via CloudWatch OAM)

- **Service**: Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager (OAM) for cross-account observability  
- **Protocol**:  
  - AWS-managed CloudWatch cross-account observability data path over HTTPS; the Control Plane uses standard CloudWatch APIs (`GetMetricData`, `FilterLogEvents`, etc.) in the monitoring account while AWS handles secure linkage to tenant source accounts[12][13][14]

- **Authentication**:  
  - AWS SigV4 using IAM roles in the Control Plane monitoring account when calling CloudWatch APIs[13][15]
  - In tenant accounts, OAM **links** are created that trust an OAM **sink** in the Control Plane account; AWS service-linked roles enable the data sharing without long‑lived credentials[14][16]

- **Authorization**:  
  - OAM sink policies (resource-based) in the Control Plane define which AWS accounts or organization IDs are allowed to create links and share specific telemetry types (metrics, logs, traces)[16][14]
  - Per-tenant OAM links in ASTRAPlane accounts explicitly opt in to sharing selected CloudWatch data with the Control Plane sink, ensuring tenant-level isolation and least-privilege visibility[12][16]

- **Data Residency & Isolation**:  
  - Telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) remains stored in the tenant’s AWS account and region; the Control Plane gains cross-account visibility without copying data, except where centralized log delivery is explicitly configured[17][12]

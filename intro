1. Introduction:

1.1 Purpose and Scope

This Product Architecture Design Document outlines the architectural blueprint for ASTRA, a next-generation business process orchestration and automation platform. ASTRA is designed to provide workflow automation while adhering to strict requirements for data residency, security, and compliance by utilizing a decoupled, hybrid deployment model.

The core objective of ASTRA is to enable users to seamlessly design, deploy, and manage complex workflows in AWS cloud environment. This document details the structure, interaction, and responsibilities of the platform's distinct components.

1.2 The Split-Plane Architecture

ASTRA is built upon a Split-Plane Architecture, strategically dividing functionality into managed, proprietary services (the Control Plane) and customer-hosted, secure execution components (the Execution Plane). This approach ensures that the critical, sensitive execution of workflows and access to client-specific resources remains strictly within the client's environment (Bring-Your-Own-Cloud - BYOC), while the operational burden of design, deployment, and management is handled by ASTRA as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering.

The architecture is composed of three primary, logically separated components:

A. The Control Plane (SaaS)

The Control Plane is the fully managed, multi-tenant SaaS component hosted and operated by the ASTRA platform team. It serves as the single source of truth for workflow management and governance.

Key Functions:

ASTRAStudio: Provides the graphical interface for designing business processes.

ASTRADeploy: Manages the promotion and deployment lifecycle of workflows to the underlying Camunda 8 engine.

ASTRATenants: Manages the entire client lifecycle, including provisioning, configuration, and user/access management for each isolated tenant.

ASTRAController: A dedicated remote agent responsible for maintaining the health of client-deployed infrastructure. It pushes updates, monitors the health of the Camunda 8 cluster, and facilitates remote debugging and bug fixes.

Orchestration Core: Includes the core workflow orchestrator (Zeebe), dashboard, and metadata catalog. This core also manages the ASTRA Action Library, which is bundled and distributed via an ECS registry for deployment in the Client Cloud (ASTRAPlane).


B. The ASTRAPlane (Strategic Execution Plane - BYOC)

The ASTRAPlane is the client-specific component, designed to be deployed and hosted within the client’s own AWS account. This component acts as a highly secure bridge between the managed Control Plane and the client's internal ecosystem.

Key Functions:

Security Context: Manages client-side access, including the necessary IAM Roles to securely access other client AWS Services during workflow execution.

Connector Runtime: Hosts the secure, tenant-specific connector container images required to execute service tasks and integrate with client endpoints.

Execution Auditing: Responsible for storing the sensitive execution and audit journals, ensuring that critical compliance data remains resident within the client's dedicated cloud environment.

C. Camunda 8 Zeebe Cluster (Workflow Orchestrator)

The Camunda 8 Zeebe Cluster is the high-performance, resilient, and scalable engine responsible for executing the automated workflows.

Key Features: It leverages the cloud-native, shared-nothing architecture of Zeebe. Critically, it implements multi-tenancy using Tenant Identifiers in a Shared Engine, Logical Isolation approach. This means a single, efficient cluster can serve multiple business units or clients. All process definitions, instances, jobs, and audit data are strictly tagged with a Tenant Id, and access is rigorously enforced through Identity, ensuring that authorized users can only interact with resources belonging to their specific tenant.
